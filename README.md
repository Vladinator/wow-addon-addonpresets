AddOnPresets
======================

AddOnPresets enables a simple way to create preset of addons that you can easily enable or disable, all at once!

You can organize all your PvP addons into one preset, and easily enable them when heading into a battleground or arena, and once you are done you can unload them all in a simple click.

The same can be done to your Gathering, Auction House, or Pet Battles activities, or whatever else you are into!
